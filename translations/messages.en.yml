                Sparknap is a brand new organized social network. It is a place where everyone can 
                interact with each other and the rest of the world by sharing posts, articles and 
                photos. 
            features: "Here are the main features of %name%:"
            posts: Publish posts
            posts_bis: Once logged in, you can post public messages which will be displayed on your personal page
            groups: Create groups
            groups_bis: >
                Create and manage your own dynamic and flexible groups. Sparknap groups allow members
                to interact with each other and the rest of the world in an organized manner. 
                Designated members have appropriate authority, access and skills for their assigned 
                position.
            join: Join other groups
            join_bis: >
                There are two ways to join other groups: sending them your application or accepting
                their invitation. It's up to the designated members to send invitations and accept
                applications
            articles: Publish articles 
            articles_bis: >
                Articles are much longer than simple posts. This is why articles can be published only
                on behalf of a group. Articles can be published and/or edited by certain members only.
            group_posts: Group posts
            group_posts_bis: >
                Sparknap groups also allow to publish posts which can be made public or restricted to only
                the group members
            photos: Share photos
            photos_bis: You can share photos and pictures by uploading them when you publish a post or an article
            elections: Plan elections
            elections_bis: >
                Elections can be held to determine who is going to be the next admin of a group. It
                consists of each member voting. 
                And it is up to the group's admin to decide whether or not elections will be held.
